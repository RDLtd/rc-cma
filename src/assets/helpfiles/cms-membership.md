## Restaurant Collective Membership

A restaurant can be a member of the Restaurant Collective at three different levels:

**Affiliate** - This is the most basic form of membership. You can view the information associated
with the restaurant, and request cahnges to the core data, but you cannot modify or add to the CMS data.

**Full** - A restaurant can upgrade to FULL membership  by paying an annual fee of Â£40.
This allows you to modify and add to your CMS data. You can also preview and edit  the simgle page website
that is automatically generated from your information.

**Premium** - Restaurant Developments Limited offer a range of additional services that
can extend the use of your data. For example, you can request that your data are distributed 
to a number of third-party websites. You can read more about the services offered [here](https://www.restaurantcollective.co.uk).
