## Location Map

Please check that the position of the red map marker is as accurate as possible. You may find it easier to **ZOOM 
IN** using the (+) sign at the bottom-right of the map.  

To adjust the map marker you can just **DRAG** it to the new 
position. Once you are happy, confirm the position by selecting the **DONE** tick/check icon on the navigation bar.
