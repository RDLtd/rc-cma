## Sample Menu

You can create a sample menu, with up to 3 sections, that will be displayed on 
your restaurant's web page. 

### Sections

You can edit the names of those sections by simply selecting them, 
making sure to save the edits by checking the **DONE** tick on the navigation bar. Sections that do not have any 
dishes, will not be displayed.

### Dishes  

To create a new dish select the **ADD** (+) button on the blue navigation bar. *TIP* you can move around the form 
quickly by using your **TAB** key.  

To edit an existing dish, select the dish card, or the **EDIT** icon.  

To remove a dish, select the **TRASH** icon.
