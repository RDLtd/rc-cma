## Content Summary

This panel provides a summarised overview of the restaurant's content with each sections colour-coded according to 
the status. 

### Green
The content in sections with a green icon and full progress bar are complete.

### Orange
Sections displaying an orange logo and progress bar are missing some data, although this may optional content.

### Black
If the section logo is black then that section does not yet have any data in it. If any of the sections are empty 
then the **Single Page Website** (SPW) cannot be created.
