## Images

Make sure that all the images you upload are of a high quality and that you legally own the copyright to those images.

Optionally select a category and,  give the image a title or make it the default (see below)

Select **UPLOAD**. You will see the upload progress and once complete, the new image will have been saved and the 
image window will automatically close. 

### Default image

Decide which image best represents the venue and mark it as the **DEFAULT** image - you can do this after 
upload by selecting the image to open it in a new modal window, then using the **MORE** menu (...) in the top right corner. The default image 
will be then used as the *hero* image on the venue's website and will also be used by 3rd party websites in their search results.

### Activate/deactivate

In addition to the default image, ideally there should be a further 3 or more images of the venue. To 
activate/deactivate an image check/uncheck the image card.

An image can be removed by selecting the **TRASH** icon.

If you need to retrieve an image from the repository, you can
download it by selecting the **CLOUD** icon.
